To make the Flood-it game we have 2 main classes, FloodItWolrd and Cell 
The FloodItWorld is the central component of a Flood-It game, defining the game world's structure and behavior. 
It encompasses several main ideas, including the representation of the game board as a 2D array of cells (which is the other class and defines each cell), 
the tracking of game parameters like board dimensions, available colors, and guesses, and the management of game state through 
methods for handling user interactions, game ticks, and end conditions. 
The FloodItWorld class also handles graphical elements, such as rendering the game board and displaying the score and timer. 
It offers various constructors to initialize the game world with different configurations and provides methods for determining win/loss conditions, 
resetting the game, and changing cell colors for testing. Overall, 
FloodItWorld encapsulates the essential components required to create and interact with a Flood-It game in a structured and modular manner.
We then have ExamplesFloodIt which holds all the tests for aboth classes.
